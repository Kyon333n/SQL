~ This is a dataset called chinook, which contains a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

~ I created a few questions about the dataset and used SQL code to gather deeper insights.



#1. Which customers are not in the U.S?

SELECT Country, FirstName, LastName, CustomerId
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'U.S';

#2. Which customers are only from Brazil? I also included the customer ID to better identify exactly which customer is from Brazil.

SELECT Country, FirstName, LastName, CustomerId
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3. Which employees are Sales Agents?

SELECT employeeid, firstname, lastname, title AS 'Sales Agent'
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title LIKE '%Sales Support Agent%'

#4. Every country that begin with the letter C. I've also included the city.

SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry,billingcity 
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE billingcountry LIKE 'C%'
ORDER BY billingcountry desc;

#5. What was the total number of invoices in the year 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_invoices
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate >= '2009-01-01' AND invoicedate <= '2009-12-31';

#6. What was the total revenue for the year 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) AS total_revenue
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate >= '2009-01-01' AND invoicedate <= '2009-12-31'

#7. What was the total sales made by each sales agent?

SELECT 
    employees.EmployeeID,
    employees.FirstName,
    employees.LastName,
    employees.Title,
    SUM(Invoices.Total) AS TotalSales
FROM 
    chinook.employees AS employees
LEFT JOIN 
    chinook.customers AS customers
ON 
    employees.EmployeeId = customers.SupportRepId
INNER JOIN 
    chinook.invoices AS Invoices
ON 
    customers.CustomerId = Invoices.CustomerId
WHERE 
    employees.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY 
    employees.EmployeeId, employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, employees.Title;
