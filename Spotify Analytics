# I downloaded a Spotify data project from Kaggle.
# I then created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Lastly, I used SQL to dig deeper into the data. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

# Next, I created questions I had about the data and explored it using the following SQL. 

#1. Which artist is the most popular?

SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, MAX(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >94
Group By popularity 
LIMIT 1;

#2. How many artist had a popularity over 85?

SELECT DISTINCT popularity,artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >84
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc; 

#3. What is the track name for the song with the highest energy?

SELECT track_name, MAX(energy) AS Highest_Energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE energy <> 'Highest Energy'
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 1;

#4. What is the track name for the song with the lowest energy?

SELECT track_name, MIN(energy) AS Lowest_Energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY energy
ORDER BY energy 
LIMIT 1;

#5. Which tracks had a tempo over 130 BPM?

SELECT DISTINCT track_name, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE tempo > 130
ORDER BY tempo ASC;

#6. How many songs had a song key over 8?

SELECT song_key, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE song_key >8
ORDER By song_key asc

#7. Who is the artist that created the song "Sweater Weather"?

SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, Track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE Track_name LIKE '%Sweater Weather%'
AND artist_name <> 'Artist'
AND track_name <> 'Track';
